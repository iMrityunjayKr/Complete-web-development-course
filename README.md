Learning and mastering web development from Udemy.
I have always loved the pedagogy of @HiteshChoudhary sir. 
So going through this course on a fastrack basis to revise all the previous concept and also learn some new core concept.
Aim is build as many project as Sir has and make myself ready for production grade coding.
